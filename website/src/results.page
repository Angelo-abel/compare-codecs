This page shows the results of encodes available on this particular site.

NOTE: All results are fake. They will be generated using Javascript from JSON-formatted data files in the eventual site.

Fixed QP results
================

This table shows the overall numeric results based on PSNR, computed
according oto the BD-PSNR method. Click on a
percentage to go to the page that shows the detailed results, and
results based on other metrics.

| | VP8-2pass | X264-2pass | HEVC-HM |
|-
| VP8-2pass | - | +10% | -12% |
| X264-2pass | -8% | - | +17% |
| HEVC-HM | -6% | +7% | - |

Note that the table is not symmetric; if A beats B by 12% when A is
the baseline, A will beat B by 8% if B is the baseline. This follows
from the way in which the percentages are computed. (FIXME: Check
numbers)

Fixed bitrate results
=====================
This table shows the overall numeric results based on PSNR and bitrate
overrun. The score for any clip is reduced by 0.1 for each second of
accumulated delay, divided by the length of the clip.

| | VP8-2pass | X264-2pass | HEVC-HM |
|-
| VP8-2pass | - | +10% | -12% |
| X264-2pass | -8% | - | +17% |
| HEVC-HM | -6% | +7% | - |

Interactive results
===================
This table shows the overall numeric results based on PSNR and bitrate
overrun. The score for any clip is reduced by 1 for each second of
accumulated delay, divided by the length of the clip.

In addition, to qualify for this ranking, an encode must be performed
using less CPU time (single CPU) than the length of the clip, and it
must have no forward looking elements - that is, a decoded frame N
must be exactly
the same no matter what the content of the original frame N+1 and
later were.

| | VP8-RT | X264-RT | HEVC-HM |
|-
| VP8 | - | +10% | DNQ |
| X264 | -8% | - | DNQ |
| HEVC | DNQ | DNQ | - |

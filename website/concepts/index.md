Important concepts for the Codec Comparision Site
-------------------------------------------------

The ways codecs can be tweaked are myriad. In order to simplify this
somewhat, this site defines a few concepts and tries to stick to them
throughout its design.

* A ''codec'' is a way to encode a video stream. Usually it
  corresponds to a specific technology (VP8, H.264, Theora), but
  sometimes it also makes sense to refer to operational modes of these
  technologies as "codecs", because the parameter sets for them are
  going to be different, or because one wants to compare two sets of
  settings for a codec in the way one usually compares technologies -
  for example VP8 2 pass mode, H.264 Constrained Baseline.
* An ''encoder'' is a codec run with a certain set of parameters. The
  parameters can be set freely, but each encoder has its own identity,
  and always produces the same results for the same video file and the
  same target bitrate. Within the context of a codec, an encoder has
  an unique identifier (an MD5 checksum over its parameters) and may
  have a name; the name can
  change over time, but the unique identifier never does.
* An ''encoding'' is an encoder applied to a certain video file. The
  only things it depends on are the video file (including its width,
  height and frames per second), the encoder, and the
  target bitrate.
* An ''encoding set'' is a set of encodings for a video file that are
  related in some deterministic way. The two most common types of
  encoding sets are encoding sets that vary the target bitrate while
  keeping the encoder constant, and encoding sets where a single
  parameter (such as a base QP) varies while all other parameters are
  kept constant.
